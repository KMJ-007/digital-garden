##### Who will contact logistic partner (buyer or seller) ?
- I think it is both, user can choose himself for logistics partner, so in this case logistic will be choosen by buyer app, and after that infromation will be passed to the seller app
- If user chooses he wants leave logistic decision on seller app, or buyer app make it default to choose logistic provider will be decided by seller app

#### How will logistic provider will get his money?
- because, here he will have two option his client can be buyer app also and seller app, and also edge case.
