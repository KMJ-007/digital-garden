I really like this philosophy, because using this we can avoid short term decision and think about long term decision.

The main idea comes from bento tiffin box which is used by japanes people, which has 4 compartment in it.

Now me: in this section, it covers that intrest which you want now, like pleasure or anything that i want now.

Future me: imagine what you would like to be in the future, if all the things goes as your plane.

Now us: it this section, it includes all our surrounding like family, friends, community and who you think as us, and what you want now to happen.

Future us: in this section, what your group/community, family, friends want to look like.

with this matrick you can make good decision.
