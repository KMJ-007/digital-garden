I was not aware about this thing is called fermi estimation, but i was using this in my 11th and 12th, to solve math calculation without using calculator.

like if there is any odd number or awekred number which is not dividable or not easy to multiply, you can take the nearest number estimation, like if there is 1/395 so you can take 1/400 easily and the answer will not differ that much, because it is estimation.

Rough estimation can be very useful when there is very low infromation in our hand, rough estimation will be near the actuall number.

this is more like common sense, we all know what are the extreme of higest and lowest, any one can say this should be in between the both the extreme 

So after this i am seeing that nothing is random in this world.

reminding me to read fooled by randomness.
