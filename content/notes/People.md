There are this bunch of guyes, they are very unique and good in their own way, in their own domain, 

I also know some people who look up to me, the only thing i want to say to them is, whoever  you look up to, give yourself some time and beat that person, I mean dont let your list to be static, it should be changing or you must have made some kind of progress, 

See them, learn things, copy them, understand the thinking process, why they are diffrent, recognise the pattern, and i think people you look up to should be 10x above your level, where you want to be someday in the future.
