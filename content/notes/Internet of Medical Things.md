Internet of Medical Things is going to evolve very rapidly in the future, but it will require some time, and right kind of environment/support, we can have robo Surgeon in short time.

when some hospital or  decides to get any IoMT device, they basically look for this indication: 

- accuracy 
- reliability

Accuracy is day by day improving, but there will be always be some amount of error, It is not that much concern, with hardware industry imoroving, and fusions of diffrent domains are improving the accuracy.

Reliability, it is little hard, but can get near by if we create standardised system, where all things are common, from protocol to every things, which will also help in going forward towards interopertiblity.


The Challanges:

Privacy:
	The main challenge in the IoMT domain is preserving the patientâ€™s privacy without degrading the security level.
	> we can handle privacy by using private and open source blockchain([Hyperledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperledger))([corda](https://github.com/corda/corda)), by using private blockchain, we protect the privacy, and open soruce because that way hyperitteration and improvment can be done very fast, and everyone can contribute to greate cause, don't know how exactly but [zk-proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) can also help us here!
	
Interoperability:
	without data privacy concerns
	> by making Interoperability on scale, we can create very fast learning & evolving ecosystem of IoMT, by using [shared Machine Learning](https://medium.com/syncedreview/shared-machine-learning-ant-financials-solution-for-data-privacy-8069cffe7bb6) we are improving the IoMT and protecting them at the same time, but major issue is that, things are not at standard, some big player will introduce his way of Interoperability his new protocol, and small player can't afford or not able to, some kind of open network protocol which is end to end encrypted, and works on predefined standard, can help in solving this challange,
	> can you imagine, one robo made one mistake, and he improved his mistake, but now all the participatens of the open network protocol can learn the same thing, without making that mistaka again, I know mistake is not accepteble here, but without trial and error, we can't get near to perfection!
	
cyber attacks:
	main and biggest threat in IoMT is security threats, cyber attacks,
	> by creating Open source ecosystem, we can handle security threats, and open soruce ecosystem will help to attract more people for contribution, and comunitty will take care of the major issues in the area, simple helping hands, it makes job more easy.
