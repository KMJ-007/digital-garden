- The other all kinds of data can be gathered without human intrest or interaction,

	We need some thing that only human can classify or need some interaction,


	But i think this is fantastic business model for new kind of ads, especially for AI companies,

	Like glib no longer have to hire to validate the results by one human and follow up, go and run this kind of intractable ads to find the results and promote the buisness

- Some decisions are truly blocked on your input: the dating app needs to know if you like the person. In other cases, due to recent advances in machine learning (e.g. OpenAI’s GPT-3 work), we can make autopilots that guess the next step for you.

	For example: an email client that procedurally opens every email and starts replying using Gmail completions unless you edit the draft. A treadmill for email. Most of the text will be wrong, and you’ll race to edit it before the ghostwriter embarrasses you, but you might get more work done.
	
	it is simple task, AI will read the mail, and creates reply draft for you, so you only have to check the draft, and if something is wrong then edit it,  dont spend time in writing whole reply, just edit,  the app can also provide tldr of whole email, so user don't have to waste the time in reading the email, and getting the context, 
	if email is mentioning the past email, or other meeting, for context, the app can also go through that and can create backlink, and include in the tldr.
	
	this is like new complete email client, this is what cron did to google calander is. completyl magical experiance.
