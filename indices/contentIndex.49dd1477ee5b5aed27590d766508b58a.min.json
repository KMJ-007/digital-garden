Often without noticing, your progress in aspects of life or all of it unconsciously becomes linear.\n- Meeting magicians is the first step to becoming one ‚Äì when you are attempting to learn implicit knowledge that by definition¬†you don‚Äôt understand, it is important to have a bunch of examples in front of you to feed your brain‚Äôs pattern-recognition systems. This will start to change your worldview without the controlling ‚Äòyou‚Äô explicitly approving or denying every new belief or framework. Magicians or their work often seem to have a subconscious glow¬†that I am drawn to, particularly if they use a type of magic that I recognise is on my critical path and thus something I‚Äôm currently seeking. Concrete steps I take to find them include asking my most interesting friends to introduce me to their most interesting friends, going down similar rabbit holes with the bibliographies of books that excite me, and generally living in ‚Äòexplore‚Äô mode at various points in life, while recognising that not every avenue will lead to a jackpot.\n- **You can‚Äôt keep your gaze tightly fixed on the outcome you want because it will lock your mind onto the strategies you currently have for meeting them, which by definition probably don‚Äôt work (otherwise you would have succeeded already and you wouldn‚Äôt need to use the strategy).**\n- a helpful strategy for becoming a magician: Surround yourself with people who look like magicians to you.
