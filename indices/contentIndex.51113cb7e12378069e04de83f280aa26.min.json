Some decisions are truly blocked on your input: the dating app needs to know if you like the person. In other cases, due to recent advances in machine learning (e.g. OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 work), we can make autopilots that guess the next step for you.\n\nFor example: an email client that procedurally opens every email and starts replying using Gmail completions unless you edit the draft. A treadmill for email. Most of the text will be wrong, and you‚Äôll race to edit it before the ghostwriter embarrasses you, but you might get more work done.\n\nit is simple task, AI will read the mail, and creates reply draft for you, so you only have to check the draft, and if something is wrong then edit it,  dont spend time in writing whole reply, just edit,  the app can also provide tldr of whole email, so user don't have to waste the time in reading the email, and getting the context, \nif email is mentioning the past email, or other meeting, for context, the app can also go through that and can create backlink, and include in the tldr.\n\nthis is like new complete email client, this is what cron did to google calander is. completyl magical experiance.","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T08:50:57.142791281Z","tags":null},"/notes/learning":{"title":"Things which are on priority to learn","content":"\n- typescript\n- postgres \n- node (mainly how to make production level apps)\n\t- file managment(how to restrict the user from accessing each other's data or better way of handling privacy of thr user)\n\t- security (anyone can make ddos attack, or access the data)\n\t- queuing jobs, like async api calling and queuing\n\t- how to make api with auth tokens, and bearer tokens, in short production level api, which can be tracable and with anyaltics\n\t- how to implement small to small detail of anyaltics in node js, how many api calls are happening or how many tasks runs\n\t- caching\n\t- depth o-auth understanding","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T08:50:57.142791281Z","tags":null},"/notes/postgres":{"title":"postgres","content":"\n\u003eI don't know how to pronounce **Postgre** properly\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T08:50:57.142791281Z","tags":null},"/notes/typescript":{"title":"notes about typescript","content":"\n\u003eEvery javascript is typescript, but every typescript is not javascript\n\n![[typescriptven.png]]\n\ntsc(typescript compiler)\n\n- [[tsconfig.json]]\n- [[package.json]]\n\n-   `.ts`¬†files contain both type information and code that runs\n-   `.js`¬†files contain only code that runs\n-   `.d.ts`¬†files contain only type information\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T08:50:57.142791281Z","tags":null},"/people/Sanatan-Dinda":{"title":"","content":"What a great artisit and painting are on the next level","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T08:50:57.142791281Z","tags":null}}
